Overall, 72,456 employees will need to be replaced in the coming years. There are not enough qualified mentors if we only accept employees born in 1965. However, if we extend the mentorship program to include the four years from 1962 to 1965, then there are more than enough employees qualified to mentor the next generation of employees.
